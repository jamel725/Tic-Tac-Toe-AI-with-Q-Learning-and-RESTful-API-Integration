# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Q-Learning-and-RESTful-API-Integration
In this project, I developed a reinforcement learning agent capable of playing Tic Tac Toe using the Q-learning algorithm. I trained the agent to learn optimal strategies through self-play, storing its learning progress in a serialized Q-table. To make the model interactive, I built a backend server using Python and Flask, exposing a REST API that handles game logic and communicates with a simple HTML frontend. This API allows users or client applications to initiate games, make moves, and receive AI responses via HTTP requests. I also integrated an SQLite database for persistent game data storage. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with reinforcement learning, RESTful API development, backend engineering, and deploying machine learning models into interactive, real-world applications.
